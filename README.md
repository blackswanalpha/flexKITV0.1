Introduction
Welcome to our Web Layout Framework! This framework is designed to simplify the process of building responsive and dynamic web pages. It provides a set of tools and components that enable developers to create complex layouts with ease.

Key Features
Container-Based Layouts: Easily create and manage container-based layouts like grid, flex, and more.
Custom Components: Integrate your custom components seamlessly into the framework.
Responsive Design: Built with responsiveness in mind, ensuring your layouts look great on all devices.
Chainable Structure: Utilize chainable methods to add and configure components in a fluid and readable manner.
Event Manager: Manage and handle events across components efficiently.
Getting Started
Installation
To include this framework in your project, simply add the following script and stylesheet references to your HTML:

html
Copy code
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/framework.css">
<script src="js/framework.js"></script>
Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s a basic example to get you started with creating a simple layout:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Web Layout Framework Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/framework.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script src="js/framework.js"></script>
    <script>
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
            const app = new LayoutFramework('#app');

            // Add GridView Layout with 4 columns
            app.addLayout('gridview', { columns: 4 })
                .addComponentOrganisms('navbar', { items: ['Home', 'About', 'Contact'] })
                .addComponentMolecule('card', { title: 'Welcome', body: 'This is the homepage' })
                .addComponentAtoms('button', { label: 'Click Me' });
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
Components
Layouts
GridView Layout: Create grid-based layouts with customizable columns.
Linear Layout: Arrange components in a linear fashion, either horizontally or vertically.
Relative Layout: Position components relative to each other.
Frame Layout: Stack components on top of each other.
Constraint Layout: Define complex layouts with constraints.
Organisms
Organisms are complex UI components made up of multiple molecules and atoms. Examples include navigation bars, forms, and cards.

Molecules
Molecules are reusable UI components made up of atoms. Examples include buttons and inputs grouped together.

Atoms
Atoms are the basic building blocks of the UI, such as buttons, inputs, and labels.

Custom Components
To integrate custom components, simply define them and add them to the framework like any other component:

javascript
Copy code
app.addComponent('customButton', {
    render: function() {
        const button = document.createElement('button');
        button.className = 'btn-secondary';
        button.innerText = 'Custom Button';
        return button;
    }
});
Event Manager
The framework includes an event manager to handle and manage events efficiently. This allows for better organization and maintenance of event listeners.
